# Industries We Serve

## Overview

Vael Creative specializes in creative content for consumer brands across five key industries. We understand the unique challenges, audiences, and creative requirements of each vertical.

## DTC & Ecommerce

We help direct-to-consumer brands create scroll-stopping content that drives conversions. Our work spans product photography, lifestyle imagery, ad creative, and video content optimized for ecommerce channels. We understand the DTC growth playbook — from customer acquisition to retention — and create content that performs at every stage of the funnel.

## Beauty & Wellness

Beauty and wellness brands need content that is aspirational yet authentic. We produce stunning product photography, lifestyle imagery, tutorial-style video content, and influencer-ready assets that resonate with beauty consumers. We understand the visual language of beauty — lighting, texture, color — and create content that stands out in a crowded market.

## CPG & Food/Beverage

Consumer packaged goods and food/beverage brands need high-volume content that maintains brand consistency across channels. We create mouthwatering product photography, recipe content, lifestyle imagery, and social media assets that drive both brand awareness and retail velocity. We help CPG brands tell their story across digital and in-store touchpoints.

## Health & Supplements

Health and supplement brands operate in a space that demands both credibility and visual appeal. We create content that educates consumers while driving purchase intent — from ingredient-focused product photography to testimonial-style video content and scientific-yet-approachable ad creative. We understand the regulatory considerations and help brands communicate effectively within guidelines.

## Hospitality & Travel

Hospitality and travel brands sell experiences, and their content needs to evoke emotion and desire. We produce destination photography, property showcases, experience-driven video content, and social media assets that transport viewers. We help hospitality brands capture the feeling of their experience in every piece of content.
