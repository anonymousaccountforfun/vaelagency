# Pricing

## Our Approach

All pricing at Vael Creative is custom-scoped based on your specific project needs, brand goals, timeline, and deliverables. We do not use one-size-fits-all pricing. Every brand is unique, so we build custom packages tailored to your specific creative needs.

## How Pricing Works

We scope each project individually based on:
- The type and volume of deliverables needed
- Your timeline and turnaround requirements
- The complexity of creative direction
- Platform-specific requirements and optimizations
- Whether you need ongoing content or a one-time project

## What Is Included

Every project includes:
- Discovery and brand alignment
- Creative strategy and direction
- AI-accelerated production
- Human creative direction and quality assurance
- One round of revisions
- Final delivery in all required formats and specifications

## Custom Packages

We build custom packages matched to specific needs, timelines, and budgets. Whether you need a one-time launch campaign, ongoing social content, or a comprehensive creative suite, we will design a package that fits.
